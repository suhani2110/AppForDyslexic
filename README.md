🧠 Dyslexia Learning Assistant

A multisensory, AI-assisted learning app for dyslexic learners

🚨 Problem Statement

Dyslexia affects nearly 1 in 10 people globally, making reading, writing, and phonetic recognition challenging—yet most learning tools remain text-heavy, non-adaptive, and inaccessible.

💡 Solution Overview

Dyslexia Learning Assistant is a mobile-first application designed to help dyslexic learners improve reading and writing through multisensory learning, AI-powered assistance, and adaptive practice.

The app combines:

Visual (writing & scanning)

Auditory (text-to-speech)

Interactive practice (levels & words)

to create a personalized and accessible learning experience.
